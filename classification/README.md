# Classification Algorithms
Some examples of Classification algorithms using Python.

## Classification problem

Classification is a central topic in machine learning that has to do with teaching machines how to group together data by particular criteria. Classification is the process where computers group data together based on predetermined characteristics — this is called supervised learning. There is an unsupervised version of classification, called clustering where computers find shared characteristics by which to group data when categories are not specified.

### Logistic Regression

In statistics, logistic regression, or logit regression, or logit model[1] is a regression model where the dependent variable (DV) is categorical. This article covers the case of a binary dependent variable—that is, where the output can take only two values, "0" and "1".
